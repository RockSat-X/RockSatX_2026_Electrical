# RockSat-X User Guide Summary.

As of writing, we will be referring to [August 31, 2023 (Rev - Draft)](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rocksat-x-user-guide-2024.pdf) version of the RockSat-X user guide.
Here are some important things to consider:

  - Electrical specifications:

    - The following powerlines are provided:

      - GSE-1 / GSE-2.
        - "Ground Station Equipment".
        - Should be used for experiment initialization.
        - Enabled pre-launch between T-600s to T-180s of our choosing.
        - Consider possibility of power-cycling. :small_red_triangle:
        - Consider possibility of no GSE provided due to lightning strike. :small_red_triangle:
        - Cannot be used for any deployments nor RF. :small_red_triangle:
        - Cutoff at about T+332.
        - Each has polyswitch fuse rated for 1.85A. :small_red_triangle:

      - TE-1 / TE-2 / TE-3.
        - "Non-Redundant Timer Events".
        - Cutoff at about T+332.
        - Each has polyswitch fuse rated for 3.75A. :small_red_triangle:

      - TE-RA / TE-RB.
        - "Redundant Timer Events".
        - Both enabled at the same time.
        - Otherwise, same characteristics as the non-redundant TEs.

    - GSEs and TEs powered by a single 1Ah battery at 28±6 V provided by the rocket. :small_red_triangle:
    - The battery provided by the rocket has max current draw of 3.75A. :small_red_triangle:

    - Additional batteries are allowed.
      - Battery and charger must be UL-listed and approved. :small_red_triangle:
      - Battery can be a rechargable lithium, but it must be charged off-site. :small_red_triangle:

    - Wireless communication is allowed.
      - No RF system should be enabled via GSE. :small_red_triangle:
      - RF system should be verifiable for GPS roll-out. :small_red_triangle:

    - Telemetry provided by the rocket includes:
      - Ten 10-bit 5V ADCs operating at 1KHz.
      - One 19200 baud UART using 8N1 format.[^telemetry-baud-speed]
      - One 16-bit parallel interface.[^parallel-interface]

  - Mechanical specifications.
    - Weight budget of 30±1 lb (13.6±0.5 kg). :small_red_triangle:
    - Height budget of 10.75 in (27.3 cm). :small_red_triangle:
    - Center of gravity within 1 in (2.5 cm) of deck-plate's normal. :small_red_triangle:
    - Withstand ~25 G in all directions with impulses of ~50 G in the thrust axis. :small_red_triangle:
    - Maximum deployment speed of 1 in/s (2.5 cm/s). :small_red_triangle:
    - Speculated reentry temperature of at least 500 °F (260 °C).
    - Experiment will be subjected to vibration testing. :small_red_triangle:
      - Thrust axis sweeping between 10Hz and 144Hz up to 3 in/s (7.6 cm/s).
      - Thrust axis sweeping between 144Hz and 2000Hz of 7G at 4 oct/min.

[^te-eg]: For example, "TE1 set to T+30s" would mean Timer-Event powerlines 1 is enabled 30 seconds after launch. There are three non-redundant TEs: TE-1, TE-2, and TE-3; there is a redundant pair of TE-RA and TE-RB which are enabled at the same time.
[^gse-eg]: For example, "GSE set to T-180s" would mean the GSE powerlines is enabled 180 seconds before launch. The timestamp should be between T-600s to T-180s.
[^telemetry-baud-speed]: The baud speed has been proposed to being increased before in the past if all other experiments on the rocket are capable of handling it.
[^parallel-interface]: Sample rate is defined in the auxilary document "RS-X Telemetry ICD".

> [!NOTE]
> Bullets marked with :small_red_triangle:
> are to be checked off as :small_blue_diamond:
> once we have verified our experiment implementation satisfies or doesn't conflict with it.
> This should be done when minimal hardware changes are to be made.

# Git Conflicts.

As you work,
you might encounter certain conflicts with other people's work.
This will happen whenever you make several commits on a branch
and so does another person independently.
As a result,
there ends up being a "divergence" between you two.

One of you will push their commits to GitHub first,
and as a result,
the other person will be the one that has an out-of-date repository.

If the files that were changed by the two of you are completely independent,
then this is often pretty easy to fix;
it is just a simple merge.

But if the two of you modified the same file
(e.g. edited the same code or tweaked the same CAD model)
then the situtation is a bit trickier.

If this situation describes you,
feel free to create a [ticket](#creating-tickets) to see how we can resolve it.
I'd put in time to explain how to do it here,
but there's a lot of things to look out for,
and besides there's plenty of resources online.

> [!TIP]
> The usage of AI in this scenario is probably good,
> since Git version control is littered with lots of weird technical terms and edge cases.
> Maybe try out GitHub's Copilot?
